Hi,

My name is Martin Szauer and I am interested in applying for the front end developer listing on the vereduscorp website. I graduated from the University of South Florida and moved to California to pursue a career in Game Development. However, I found that I get much more satisfaction and enjoyment from being a Web Developer with a full-stack knowledge. I am looking to move back to Tampa and was looking at job listings.

The question I have is what is veredus looking for in a portfolio? I have started creating a new portfolio for my career in Web Development and including projects and code that I created for the Game Development industry just doesn't seem like it'd be a good idea. I am very interested in this position, but as my portfolio is empty/weak right now I would really appreciate the chance to hear what type of things veredus is looking for.

You can reach me back via this email, or feel free to give me a call at (415) 240-8954.

Regards,
Martin Szauer
